# Colorful Technical Analysis Summary

I developed this tool to help my daytrade actions.

## How to Get data
To get your data
- go to investing.com, then watchlist
- add stocks/symbols you want to have into your watchlist
- On the upper-right corner you will see 3 dots that leads you to "Download Watchlist"
- After clicking it, choose "All tabs and columns available"
- Copy the data in the page and paste it into your data.csv file. 
- You could do this daily when market is closed

(Optional, After saving your data from investing)
- You could run the getdailydata.py file by arranging the name_fix function
- With this file, you will add important daily moving averages to your data
- If the data has these features, .html file will be created accordingly. 

## Outputs

After you get the data, run the summary.Rmd file to get .html output.

In the output, technical summaries for different intervals are colored. Moreover, daily support/resistance/pivot prices are added based on https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/technical-analysis/technical-indicator-guide/pivot-points-resistance-support

## How I use this

This part may be written in the future, maybe not.
